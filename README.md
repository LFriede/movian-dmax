# Movian DMAX Plugin

This plugin enables you to view full TV episodes from DMAX (german TV station) series in Movian.


## Installation
At the moment this plugin is not available in Movians official repository, because Movian has problems playing the HLS streams from DMAX so it is not very useful atm.   
If you want to install the plugin manually just "play" the zip file with Movian and it will be installed.

If you are developing it's easier to use the -p command line argument of Movian followed by the path of the folder containing the plugin data.
